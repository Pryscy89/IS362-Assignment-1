Assignment 1  Part 1 and 2


Part 1. SQL and NULLs

1. How many airplanes have listed speeds? What is the minimum listed speed and the maximum listed speed?

There are 23 airplanes with listed speeds. Both of these statements give 23.
The maximum speed listed is 432 and the minimum is 90. Given by the MAX and MIN functions below.
 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM planes
    	WHERE speed IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(speed) FROM planes;
 
SELECT MAX(speed) FROM planes;
SELECT MIN(speed) FROM planes;


2. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013? What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is missing?

The total distance flown by all the planes in the flights table is 350,217,607 miles (on 336,776 flights). 
The total distance flown by all the planes 1/2013 is 27,188,805 miles (on 27,004 flights)
The total distance flown by all of the planes in 1/2013 where the tailnum is missing = 81,763 (on 155 flights)
 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance' FROM flights;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance' FROM flights
    	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1);
 
SELECT COUNT(tailnum) FROM flights;     	# 334,264
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights
    	WHERE tailnum IS NOT NULL;              	# 334,264
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights
    	WHERE tailnum IS NULL;                          	#   2,512
 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance' FROM flights
    	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1)
    AND tailnum IS NULL;


3. What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5, 2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer? Write this statement first using an INNER JOIN, then using a LEFT OUTER JOIN. How do your results compare?

I get 682 flights that day with a total distance of 755,337 miles for the INNER Join. This was grouped by 
14 manufacturers, however, 2 of these were Airbus named differently, 3 were McDonnell Douglas, which gives 11.
The LEFT JOIN has 140 additional flights with a total of 127,671 miles grouped to NUL or no listed manufacturer.
 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
INNER JOIN planes
ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY manufacturer;
 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
LEFT JOIN planes
ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY manufacturer;


4. Write and answer at least one question of your own choosing that joins information from at least three of the tables in the flights database.


What airports had the most filghts as destinations on July 7, 2013 grouped by manufacturer
 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', name AS 'Airport', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
LEFT JOIN airports ON flights.dest = airports.faa
LEFT JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY faa, manufacturer;

PART 2

The SQL script used to pull data into a .CSV file.

SELECT Month, Airport, AVG(DepartureDelay) as AvgDelay
FROM Flights
WHERE Year = 2013 AND Airport IN ('JFK', 'LGA', 'EWR')
GROUP BY Month, Airport
ORDER BY Month, Airport;
